# CipherNet-PyTorch-Model

**Overview:**
CipherNet is a deep neural network designed for binary classification tasks. This model has been implemented using PyTorch and is suitable for scenarios where you need to predict binary outcomes, such as fraud detection or spam classification.

**Features:**

The model architecture consists of three fully connected layers with ReLU activation functions, offering flexibility in capturing complex patterns within the data.
Utilizes the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function for efficient training on binary classification tasks.
Standard scaling is applied to input features for improved convergence during training.

**Performance:**

Trained on a dataset split into training and testing sets, with hyperparameters fine-tuned for optimal performance.
Evaluation metrics include accuracy on the test set, providing insights into the model's ability to make accurate predictions.

**Usage:**

Load the preprocessed data.
Initialize and train the CipherNet model using the provided PyTorch implementation.
Evaluate the model on the test set to assess its performance.
Save the trained model for future use or deployment.

**Note:**

Fine-tuning hyperparameters and adjusting the model architecture may be necessary depending on the characteristics of your specific dataset.

**Instructions:**

Load your dataset and preprocess it accordingly.
Adapt the provided PyTorch code to match the input features and labels of your dataset.
Train the model and evaluate its performance on your test set.
Save the model using torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'pytorch_model.pth').
Upload the saved model file ('pytorch_model.pth') along with this description to Kaggle.
